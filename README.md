## 📖 Core Components

### 1. Transaction Class
- Represents individual transactions in the blockchain
- Stores sender, receiver, amount, Zakat amount, and timestamp
- Supports different transaction types (genesis, transfer, zakat, mining_reward)

### 2. Block Class
- Represents a block in the blockchain
- Contains multiple transactions, previous hash, and unique hash
- Uses roll number as seed key for hash calculation
- Implements proof-of-work mining

### 3. ZakatBlockchain Class (Enhanced Multi-Node)
- **Multi-node network management** with unlimited participants
- **Creator-based initialization** with seed key generation
- **Node registration system** with individual statistics tracking
- **Cross-node transaction validation** and balance management
- **Collaborative mining** allowing any node to mine blocks
- **Real-time analytics** with comprehensive network statistics
- **Gift transaction support** for educational scenarios without Zakat deduction

## 💡 How It Works

### Multi-Node Network Initialization
1. **Creator Setup**: Enter your roll number (becomes network creator and seed key)
2. **Initial Balance**: Set starting balance (default: 200 coins)
3. **Genesis Block**: Automatically created with creator as first node
4. **Network Expansion**: Add other students/participants as nodes to the network

### Enhanced Transaction Types

#### 🕌 Zakat Payment
- Automatically calculates 2.5% of current balance (Islamic requirement)
- Can transfer to Zakat Fund or any network participant
- Maintains permanent record for religious compliance

#### 💸 Transfer Coins
- Send coins to any network participant or custom address
- Automatically deducts 2.5% Zakat along with transfer amount
- Real-time balance validation and transaction preview

#### 🎁 Gift Transactions (Educational Feature)
- Special transfers between network nodes without Zakat deduction

- Real-time mining progress and difficulty adjustment

### Security Features

#### 🔐 Hash-based Security
- Each block contains cryptographic hash of previous block
- Roll number used as seed ensures hash uniqueness
- Any tampering changes hash and invalidates chain

#### ✅ Chain Validation

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Multi-Node Architecture
```python
def add_node(self, roll_number: str, initial_balance: float = 200.0) -> bool:
    """Add a new node to the blockchain network"""
    if roll_number in self.nodes:
        return False
    
    self.nodes[roll_number] = {
        'roll_number': roll_number,
        'balance': initial_balance,
        'joined_at': datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),
        'transactions_count': 0,
        'total_zakat_paid': 0.0,
        'total_zakat_received': 0.0,
        'is_active': True
    }
    return True
```

### Enhanced Hashing Algorithm
```python
def calculate_hash(self) -> str:
    # Creator's roll number as seed key for network uniqueness
    block_string = f"{self.roll_number}:{self.index}:{transactions_str}:{self.previous_hash}:{self.timestamp}:{self.nonce}"
    return hashlib.sha256(block_string.encode()).hexdigest()
```

### Gift Transaction Support
```python
def create_gift_transaction(self, sender: str, receiver: str, amount: float) -> bool:
    """Create gift transaction without Zakat deduction for educational purposes"""
    if self.get_balance(sender) >= amount:
        gift_transaction = Transaction(sender, receiver, amount, 0.0, "gift")
        self.pending_transactions.append(gift_transaction)
        return True
    return False
```

### Zakat Calculation
```python
def calculate_zakat(self, balance: float) -> float:
    return balance * 0.025  # 2.5% Islamic requirement
```

### Transaction Validation
```python
def validate_transaction(self, transaction: Transaction) -> bool:
    sender_balance = self.get_balance(transaction.sender)
    total_amount = transaction.amount + transaction.zakat_amount
    return sender_balance >= total_amount
```
